    "to each \"event\" (i.e. to each collision) can be quite complex, as it includes information from basic detector signals to the different particles reconstructed and their measured properties. In High Energy Physics usually it is used a complex data structure called \"tree\", within the ROOT framework, that helps the data access. \n",

    "We will use derived [open data files from CMS](http://opendata.cern.ch/) that include many thousands of collisions. These files contain the muon and electron collections in PAT candidate format derived from the full 2010 RunB Muon ([DOI: 10.7483/OPENDATA.CMS.RJW2.QP44](http://opendata.cern.ch/record/201)) or Electron ([DOI: 10.7483/OPENDATA.CMS.HHTK.9FS2](http://opendata.cern.ch/record/202)) primary datasets. No filters are applied, apart from the list of the validated runs. \n",
