In High Energy Physics, within the ROOT framework, it is usually used this complex data structure called \"tree\" to help the data access. \n",

    "#### Creating the public key\n",
    "In order to create a public key in your computer and to establish a relation between that public key and your ssh user you will need to procedure and to type some commands in the terminal of your computer. First at all, you need to open a terminal in your own computer and follow the next instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Check for ssh keys\n",
    "We need to ckeck whether there are pre-existing ssh public keys in your computer. For that, you need to type on the terminal the command **ls -al $\\sim$/.ssh**.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you receive an error that $ssh$ doesn't exist, don't worry! This means you do not have any ssh key and we will create it in the following step (see Figure 3).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Generate a new SSH Key\n",
    "With the terminal still open you must type (or copy and paste) the next command: **ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C \"your$\\_$user@cmsopendata.ifca.es\"**. Your$\\_$user is the ssh user you observe in Figure 2. \n",
    "\n",
    "At the moment you type the command **ssh-keygen**, some questions related to the file where the ssh key will be save pop up. We suggest keeping the default settings to avoid problems in the future, so when you are prompted to \"Enter a file in which to save the key\", just press *Enter* to continue. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, you will be asked to write a passphare to save your SSH key. You can decide yourself if you want to include a password or not. At the end you will see the key fingerprint you have created.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Add your key to the SSH-agent\n",
    "With the key already created, you are able to configure the SSH-agent program to use the SSH Key. You will need to type the commands **eval \"$\\$$(ssh-agent -s)\"** and **ssh-add $\\sim$/.ssh/id$\\_$rsa**\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Add your SSH key to the Analysis web page\n",
    "\n",
    "First, you will need to move to the directory where the public key is contained using **cd /.ssh** and open with vim the file *id$\\_$rsa.pub*. For that, you must type **vim id$\\_$rsa.pub**. Simply copy the text shown in vim using your computer mouse.\n",
    "\n",
    "After copying the key, go again to the analysis web page at the SSH Access view as it is shown in Figure 5.2, and paste the key in the blank space under the name public Key.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Access from your terminal using the public key\n",
    "At the end, you will be able to open a new terminal and type the command line: **ssh -i id$\\_$rsa.pub cms0056@cmsopendata.ifca.es**. In case you decided to include a password when creating your SSH public key, it will be asked after pressing enter.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Voilà!*, you can connect know to the VM without going into your internet browser, just using the terminal. In that case, you just need to open a new terminal and tab on it: **ssh -X cms0056@cmsopendata.ifca.es**. The command **-X** enables the possibility of popping out plots and graphs in new windows directly from the VM. This will be required in order to look at the different plots of the particles magnitudes a the moment of analyzing the data. \n"
